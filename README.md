## About Me

I am a second-year student majoring in International Finance at Foreign Trade University (FTU).

I am curious about the intersection of Technology and Finance, and I am currently exploring the field of Data Analytics to better understand how data can support financial decision-making.

I am interested in building a strong academic foundation while gradually developing practical skills that can be applied in real-world financial and analytical contexts.

I value consistency, continuous learning, and long-term growth.
